  "description": "This token represents the veCRV-DAO yVault which is holding Vote-Escrowed CRV. This vault converts your CRV into yveCRV, earning you a continuous share of Curve fees which are boosted over what you earn staking at Curve. The more CRV converted, the greater your weekly rewards. Every Friday, these can be claimed from the vault as 3Crv. Yearn, itself, deposits 10% of all CRV earned into this vault and gives its 3crv rewards to vault {{token}} holders which is where the boosted weekly rewards come from. Depositing is non-reversible: You can only convert CRV into yveCRV, as the CRV is perpetually staked in Curveâ€™s voting escrow.",
