The protocol is based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and offers users access to highly liquid synthetic assets (synths). Synths track and provide returns on the underlying asset without requiring one to directly hold the asset. SNX tokens are used for protocol governance and can also be used as collateral to mint synths.",
