  "description": "Hegic is an on-chain options trading protocol that is powered by hedge contracts and liquidity pools on Ethereum (ETH). A hedge contract is an options-like, on-chain contract that gives the holder or buyer a right to buy or sell an asset at a certain price (strike) as well as imposes an obligation on the writer or seller to buy or sell an asset at a certain time period. HEGIC tokens are used for protocol governance and can be staked for protocol fees.",
