  "description": "Ether, or ETH, is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. Wrapped ETH, or WETH, refers to an ERC-20 compatible version of ether. ERC-20 is a technical standard developed after the release of ETH that allow tokens created on the Ethereum blockchain to interact with each other. \nIn order for ETH to be exchanged with other ERC-20s it needs to be wrapped into WETH. Wrapping ETH does not affect its value, 1 ETH = 1 WETH.",
