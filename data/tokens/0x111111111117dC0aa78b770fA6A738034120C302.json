  "description": "1inch is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, connecting several DEXes into one platform to allow its users to find the most efficient swapping routes across all platforms. In order for a user to find the best price for a swap, they need to look at every exchange â€” DEX aggregators eliminate the need for manually checking, bringing efficiency to swapping on DEXs. 1INCH tokens are used for protocol governance and can be staked for protocol fees.",
