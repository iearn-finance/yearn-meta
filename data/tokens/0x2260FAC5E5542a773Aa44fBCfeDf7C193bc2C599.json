  "description": "Wrapped Bitcoin is a tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC) that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. The Wrapped Tokens project, of which WBTC is a part, was founded as a joint project of three organizations: BitGo, Kyber Network and Ren. BitGo also serves as the entity that holds WBTC tokens and the keys needed to mint more of them. WBTC is backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio via a network of automatically monitored merchants and custodians.",
